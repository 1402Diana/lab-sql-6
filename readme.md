# Lab | SQL Queries 6

We are going to do some database maintenance. We have received the film catalog for 2020. We have just one item for each film, and all will be placed in store 2. All other movies will be moved to store 1. The rental duration will be 3 days, with an offer price of 2.99€ and a replacement cost of 8.99€. The catalog is in a CSV file named **films_2020.csv** that can be found at `files_for_lab` folder.

### Instructions

- Add the new films to the database.
- Update inventory.
